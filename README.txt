About:
	This repository records the complete workflow that produced the analysis from the data. 
	Each folder contains a "README.txt" to guide through the repo. Data are deposited in the DRYAD, 
	and corresponding code is given in the GitHub repo named "BioDyn". The core software dependency is R, R-Studio. 
	Codes are written and performed by Ghosh with R version 4.0.5 on a windows 10 laptop. This repository is intended
	to record a workflow, and is not designed or tested for distribution and wide use on multiple platforms. For any reproducibility 
	issue, you may contact S. Ghosh at ghoshshyamolina89@gmail.com
