About:
	This repository records the complete workflow that produced the analysis from the data. 
	Each folder contains a "README.txt" to guide through the repository. Data are deposited in the ZENODO, 
	and corresponding code is given in the GitHub repo named "BioDyn" (https://github.com/sghosh89/BioDyn). 
	The core software dependency is R, R-Studio. 
	Codes are written and performed by Ghosh with R version 4.0.5 on a windows 10 laptop. This repository is intended
	to record a workflow, and is not designed or tested for distribution and wide use on multiple platforms. 
	For any reproducibility issue, you may contact S. Ghosh at ghoshshyamolina89@gmail.com 

Funding and acknowledgement:
	The authors thank David Vasseur for getting the requested data from a published article with no open data. 
	We also thank Dr. Shahid Naeem for his constructive feedback on the initial draft of the manuscript. 
	We thank the ETH Board for funding through the Blue-Green Biodiversity (BGB) Initiative 2020, 
	the Seehausen/Eawag lab and European Research Council under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and 
	innovation program (grant agreement No 787638) granted to CHG. We would like to thank the large number of 
        scientists and volunteers that contributed to long-term data collection, and the data providers who chose 
        to openly publish and share their datasets for continued analysis.
