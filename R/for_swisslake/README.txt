# for phytoplankton data
# I have considered June-September month from each sampling year for each lake - only considered years which were sampled for 
# these 4 months (consistent sampling effort per year): but some months may be sampled at multiple dates than other month -
# then we compute mean of abundance data for each identified species for each year for each lake.

# for Blake (select_sp_forBlake.R):
# I have prepared a table(csv file) that gives for each lake:
# column1: species list, 
# column2: total year sampled for that lake, 
# column3: species present for how many years,
# column4: total abundance of that species throughout the years for that lake, 
# column5: included: 0 - to be replaced by 1 if Blake wants that species (for Blake)

# Note: I want to choose species which were present at least 70% of the total year sampled - these will be the set for common target species.
