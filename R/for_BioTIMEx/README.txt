# Here we used finally 10 datasets:
# carpenter 2016, Gross 2016, Landis 2018, Lightfoot 2015, Phytoplankton 1975 - these 5 datasets are stored in DATA/for_BioTIMEx/raw_data folder.
# These can be downloaded and saved automatically in the above path when you run their corresponding 
# scripts in BioDyn/R/for_BioTIMEx/data wrangling/ path.
# The rest 5 datasets: Baikal Phytoplankton, Cumbrian Phytoplankton, Cumbrian Zooplankton, Oneida lake fishtrawl, Oneida lake fishgillnet
# were already stored in the corresponding folders of BioDyn/R/for_BioTIMEx/data wrangling/ path.
# You can wrangle those 10 datasets by calling 2.0_wrangling_raw_data.r

# The complete analysis can be done by running single file: Master_BioTIMEx.R
