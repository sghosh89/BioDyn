Also, we are providing a metadata-summary as a csv file for the data included in the analysis
Each row (observation) is considered as a community.
Columns are:
source: database/source from where data are taken
STUDY_ID: identification of each study for the corresponding datasource
newsite: plot id if multiple plots are nested within each STUDY_ID, for single plot STUDY_ID=newsite
REALM: Freshwater or Terrestrial (two categories)
TAXA: Taxon name (seven categories)
ORGANISMS: organisms' name
CENT_LAT: central lattitude
CENT_LONG: central longitude
initR: initial species richness for each community
nsp: species richness considered for each community (sampled 70% of the total study period)
nyr: number of sampled years included in the analysis (>=20 years)
startyr: starting year of the study
endyr: ending year of the study
