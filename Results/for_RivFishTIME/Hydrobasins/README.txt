In this current folder, we downloaded and saved data (Data type = Standard) only for level_08 and 
for North America, Europe, and Africa as these are relevent for 
our 551 hydrobasins included in this study.

Then using the script "R/for_RivFishTIME/basin_area.R", we extracted 
the area for 551 hydrobasins included in our study.

We are providing here the csv file we 
generated "hydrobasin551_area_extracted.csv", the last column is the 
hydrobasin area in Sq. Km.
